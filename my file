Command Line

#! - hashbang, used to create the beginning of the script, identifies script as a script 

# - comment, often used to describe what this part of the script does, is not ran by the script

Command Lists - 
	;  - Permits putting two or more commands on the same line, execute in order no dependance
	;; - 
	& - Run the job in background
	&& - Allows you to do something based on whether or not the previous command was completed successfully 
	|| - Allows you do do another command if the previous one had failed

$ - Retrieve variable with the variable name after $
! - Substitute the most recent command/history
Alias - Create a shorter command to do a large command, example can be ls (alias rm="rm -i”)
“ - Preserves the literal value of all characters within there, exceptions of $ ` / !
() - Used to create a sub shell, allows you to perform operations without affecting the current shell environment
$() - Command substitution 
$(()) - Syntax for arithmetic expansion

Expressions
String vs numeric - numeric i=$(( i + 1 )) string if [ "$a" = "$b" ]
Unary and binary tests -***

Commands to search for text
grep - grep -rl "string" /path
cut - cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd
sed - sed -n 'cdzula' README.md  
awk - $ awk -F":" '{ print $3 " " $1 }' /etc/passwd
	 $ awk '/X11Forwarding/, /^$/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

Locate files
find - find bash (if in current directory)
ls - ls -R bash

Job control, foreground and background
^Z - Control-Z suspends the most recent foreground process (the last process to interact with the tty) 
jobs - Alternate way of listing your own process, -l -p
fg - Places a process in the foreground, alongside jobs to get ID %
bg - Places a process in the background, alongside jobs to get ID %

Sorting data
sort - sort data.txt > new.txt to create new file, can be used alongside ls, sorts alphabetically and numerally, can be piped
uniq - sort -u names-list.txt  removes duplicate lines

ls - list
du - disk usage du -sh (summarize) (human reading)
ps - snapshot of current processes

I/O and Signals
> - is greater than 
>> - command output, redirect stdout to a file
< - less than
<< - command output, redirect stdout to a file?
<& - redirect stdout and stderr of cmd to file
>>& -
#> -
#>&# -
| - pipe to next command

STDIN -  this is the file handle that your process reads to get information from you.
STDOUT - your process writes normal information to this file handle.
STDERR - your process writes error information here.
File Descriptors 
0 - STDIN
1 - STDOUT
2 - STDERR
User input and prompting
echo "Do you wish to install this program?"
select yn in "Yes" "No"; 
do    
case $yn in        
Yes ) make install; break;;        
No ) exit;;    
esacdone

Signals and traps
kill - terminate process without having to logout or anything (PID)
trap - ignore signals like ctrl c, cleanup

Variables
syntax -
arrays - An array is a variable containing multiple values. 
hashes - declare -A ${#var}, ${#arr[*]}, ${#arr[@]}
environment vs local variables 
Environment - used to configure other commands or programs, inherited by child shells
Local = shell variable, used for configuring shell itself, storing data, or command output, local to a single shell by default, non inherited by child shells
PATH - environment variable, tells the shell which directories to search for executable files
USER - environment variable , get username ?? - create user possibly
HOME - root directory
Positional parameters - Arguments passed to the script from the command line [1] : $0, $1, $2, $3 . . .$0 is the name of the script itself, $1 is the first argument, $2 the second, $3 the third, and so forth. [2] After $9, the arguments must be enclosed in brackets, for example, ${10}, ${11}, ${12}.The special variables $* and $@ denote all the positional parameters.
Exit status - anything other than 0 indicates error, 

Execution Control
|| - first command succeed the second won’t be executed
&& - only executed if the first commands returns exit code of 0
[] - regular comment 
if then fi - conditionals, if expression THEN statement is only excited when expression is true, to end it
if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then               
	echo expression evaluated as true            
else               
	echo expression evaluated as false            
fi

while do done - if control expression is true, and only stops when it is false
 #!/bin/bash          
COUNTER=0         
while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do             
	echo The counter is $COUNTER             
	let COUNTER=COUNTER+1          
done

until do done -The until loop is very similar to the while loop, except that the loop executes until the TEST-COMMAND executes successfully. As long as this command fails, the loop continues. The syntax is the same as for the while loop
for var in list do done - no idea 
for ((init; test; action)) do done - Initscripts often make use of case statements for starting, stopping and querying system services.
case var in list do done - Initscripts often make use of case statements for starting, stopping and querying system services.
functions - function build() {
   ...
}

Script Management
Execution methods - chmod +x ./script.sh
Storage and permissions - chmod 777 755 700 666 644 600 chown ls -l /bin/bash
Debugging - bash -x ./script.sh
Error handling and logging of messages - use trap? set -e ? 
Sourcing scripts - chmod +x going to be sourced #!/bin/bashm $PATH
Environment files - ~/.bashrc 		/etc/bashrc
